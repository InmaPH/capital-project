Using dummy data, this project aims to analyse hardware spending.

Packages used: Faker

1) Create dataset.
Usually in a business setting this data is available for extraction and transformation. However, since this project is just a showcase, I'll be using dummy data that would be similar to what companies have available in their FinOps environment.

Faker is a Python library that allows us to create random data points that can be stored into a dataset. 
For this particular case, I'll be using:

       - 'First Name'
       - 'Last Name'
       - 'Email'
       - 'Phone Number'
       - 'Location'
       - 'Profession'
       - 'Company'
       - 'Date'
